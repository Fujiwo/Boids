Boids is an artificial life simulation originally developed by [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/).
Boids simulates the three behaviors of each individual animal in a group:
* Separation: steer to avoid crowding
* Alignment: steer towards the average heading of the group
* Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of the group
